among others... should probably add Collins' rules of Mixing</p><p>John Hanes mix process:</p><ol>
<li data-line="0">Listen to the whole song and do basic leveling&nbsp;</li>
<li data-line="1">Listen to individual tracks for errors, gradually unmuting&nbsp;</li>
<li data-line="2">Do vocal edits</li>
</ol><p>Things to do next:</p><p>Remove frequency overlap by use of eq, volume, panning, or compression&nbsp;</p><p>Ensure the frequencies of the track are balanced to taste (I.e, the bass is hitting right)</p><p>Remove any unnecessary frequencies if they interfere with the song</p><p>Create a sonic space via the use of reverbs and delays&nbsp;</p><p>Vary dynamics and bring elements in and out for emotional impact&nbsp;</p><p>If in a rush, don’t nitpick. Fix things that stick out. Don’t concentrate too hard. Let your subconscious hear things that aren’t hitting right. Vary the volume and don’t burn out your hearing on trivial things.&nbsp;</p><p>Listen soft, if the words are not audible the vocal is muddy&nbsp;</p><p>Listen to the mix while not paying attention, this tells you what sticks out, what is missing…</p><p>clarity, contrast, depth, space, texture, and balance</p><p>anything that sticks out or is distracting</p><p><a data-href="Car Test" href="Car Test.html" class="internal-link" rel="noopener">Car Test</a></p><p>snare trick-- maharath</p><p>• “Yes! 100% in the box mixing. The 'bounce to disk' is what is sent to clients and to mastering. Never touches analog in the mix, no external summing, no console. Everything is routed out the A 1-2 Master Fader.”</p><p>• For Ariana Grande’s “Thank You, Next” single files arrived in the morning and had to be out to mastering by that evening.</p><p>In these cases you have to fall back to basics. Make the mix sound good overall, don’t nitpick fine details. Fix things that stick out. Don’t get panicked and spend every hour working on the mix; get a good mix going, then walk away. Work on something else for a while; come back with a fresh perspective. Do the mixing in many shorter sessions rather than one long one; it is totally counter-intuitive when a deadline is crushing you; but your first 30 minutes of mixing might be your most productive; so create those first mix revelations over and over again.</p><p>Don't concentrate too hard, let you subconscious hear things that aren't hitting right. Vary the volume, listen loud for a bit, listen soft for a bit, don't burn out your hearing trying to get the chest-thump on the kick.</p><p>• To narrow that down to a Top-5 of what I choose when I am choosing the plugins comes up with a list of things that mostly I have used for a long time and are familiar with.</p><p>Metric Halo ChannelStrip 3: This is no secret; it is the first go-to EQ / channelstrip picked for anything. This is mainly due to comfort level. When you are comfortable working on a console like an SSL 4000, you grab the eq knob or the compressor knob without really looking at it and turn it to what feels right. You don’t need to look at the printing to see if that is 1.5kHz or 3kHz, if the Q is 2 or .5; you have muscle memory by experience and feel.</p><p>It is that same familiarity with this plugin; I can just grab the handles in the EQ window, or quickly click buttons or type in values and set it the way I want. No hunting for functions or hidden settings.</p><p>Waves CLA-76: the first thing I try on vocals. Blacky, 4:1 and hit about -3dB compression generally. Bluey, 4:1 and -10dB compression for in your face.</p><p>Waves Renaissance DeEsser: Another old friend. Frequency 5500, hit about -6dB and adjust to taste.</p><p>Vocal channels generally get Compressor, then EQ, then De-Esser. <strong>If I need to clean out low-free on it, I’ll put an Avid EQ3 1-band EQ and filter the lows before compressor.</strong></p><p>Ozone RX-7: really quick to clean up track noise, mouth noise, repairs.</p><p>Valhalla Vintage Verb: very popular on sessions sent to us, so is has become a go-to tool.</p><p>Waves H-Delay or Avid Mod Delay III: good basic delays; if I’m looking for more specialized effects there are a world of them to choose from.</p><p>Avid Lo-Fi: add a tiny bit of distortion (.1-.5) or saturation (.1-.4) to smooth synth cymbals.</p><p>Kiloheartz: I’ve been falling in love with these, simple utility interfaces, easy to understand. <strong>Distortion; add hard clip and distortion to an 808</strong> to bring forward on small speakers. <strong>Chorus to add body to BGV, Haas for spreading a mono track, all sound good.</strong></p><p>• I Always mix with the vocal on. I don't mix an instrumental and then add the vocals. First step after getting to the "good rough mix" stage is get the vocals sitting right, and then go and mix the instruments with the vocals in the mix.</p><p>Listen really soft; can you hear and understand the words? If not, vocals are too low or muddy.</p><p>Listen without concentrating; play the mix down while doing something else. What sticks out, what is missing when you are not in full concentration mode.</p><p>Any particular EQ, compressor, verbs, etc. that I use and rely on are not because they are in any way special or amazing, but because I am comfortable with them.</p><p>• We have one standard mix buss chain that is used on everything. We mix through it, meaning it goes on at the beginning of the mixing process and the whole process of mixing is done with it in place.</p><p>It is mostly “set and forget”, but there are times when small adjustments might be made to overall EQ, compassion, limiting, etc.</p><p>When we get sessions from producers that have their own mix bus chains in place, we’ll review what they are doing with each plugin. Some things we will keep in place because it has become an integral part of their rough mix. Other things can be removed or replaced by our own tools. Quite often just removing some things from the rough mix chain will make the mix better right away.</p><p>I won’t share exactly what we use here, as that chain was developed and perfected by Serban and is his “proprietary” information to keep to himself if he wishes.</p><p>We generally leave little for the mastering engineer to do. It takes a great skill to take it to that “sounds like it’s already mastered” place, so definitely a pro move.</p><p><strong>So on a typical loud mix, at the loudest part of the song, on my DK Audio meter, set to NBC scale which is AES full scale, we’ll be sitting around -6, with peaks to -4.</strong></p><p>On the Waves WLM Meter, which I normally look at just for Atmos mixing, it is pretty crushed at about -6LUFS at the loudest part of the song.</p><p>On occasion the mastering engineer will ask us to bring it down, and rightfully so. Other times, the artist or producer will say we like the mix better than the mastering, can you ask them to pass it straight through.</p><p>• I'm not a producer or writer, so I don't' have any real-world experience here to give you.</p><p>I might suggest some divisions of labor though. When you start mixing, try to use what you've already recorded, try not to fix a mix issue with adding new parts.</p><p>Take some time between your production phase and your mixing phase. Take a few days, maybe a week of not listening to your song; then approach it with a clean perspective.</p><p>• There have been several times during my career when I've been near broke, not getting any work, getting work and not being paid for it, and wondering if it will ever get better.</p><p>I've seized hold of every opportunity I've been given and tried to make myself indispensable in every situation.</p><p>My advice is that it will be really hard, you might get used and abused, it is a grind. You might get lucky, like I have, and make a career out of it, but you need a backup plan and a paying job until that happens.</p><p>If you get a job as an assistant engineer, absorb everything, learn everything. Make yourself available anytime, anywhere to be ready to work. Be kind, be humble, understand that you are easily replaceable and find a way to make yourself not easily replaceable. Know how to learn on your own; don't' ask a lot of questions when people are busy, figure out the why and how by watching and listening. Ask questions later when everyone is relaxed.</p><p>Don't make any enemies; you never know who might be the next A&amp;R or head of a label for example.</p><p>• A bit more for young engineers;</p><p>Protect your hearing; carry earplugs, wear them in noisy environments. Don't go to a lot of loud concerts. Don't be afraid to step out of the room or put in earplugs if someone cranks up the mains.</p><p>Practice mixing; maybe you can share work with other young engineers. You mix theirs, they mix yours. Feel what it is like to work on someone else's songs and sessions. Practice the communication and understanding of trying to put mixing notes into words.</p><p>Practice recording; find a way to get studio time if you have any access. maybe after you've documented and are breaking down a session, have someone play the drums while you move microphones and listen. Have someone play guitar while you move mics around the speaker cabinet.</p><p>The most important thing getting a foothold for me starting out was making sure I was impressing people. Put the clients first. Show up early, stay late, anticipate problems and solutions. Know how to do things; how quickly can you change a blown woofer, what do you do if a mic cable is bad and crackling, etc. You will not be judged first on your abilities with sound. You will be judged first on your reliability. You'll be judged on your ability with sound later, but you have to get to that place first.</p><p><strong>DRUMS</strong></p><p>• I like to process a live drum kit through an aux buss with a channel strip on it overall; also doing things on the individual channels. Mostly this is because when you’ve got good balances on a live kit it is easier to then do overall changes to the aux. I usually try to start with the OverHeads, and then add in the kick, snare, hat. I’ll often do a lot of editing and compression on the toms to just capture the meat and mute the bleed of other drums. Much of that sound is otherwise in the overheads.</p><p>I don’t tend to use much parallel compression tactics unless it comes that way from the producer.</p><p>I generally prefer to treat drum tracks separately rather than bussing all kicks, all snares together. If it is useful for a specific reason, then summing is fine as well. If there are a number of samples, <strong>try playing with their phase instead of just trying EQ and Compression. (If I slide this kick sample 100 samples left or right does it sound better or worse?)</strong></p><p>Drums are usually the next thing after vocals that require a lot of attention and mind melding with the producers. Everyone is careful about their drum sound, so If I can see that a producer has put a lot of thought and energy into their drum production, I’ll tend to leave it mostly intact.</p><p>A lot of the drum vibe is created during production. on Dua Lipa “Blow Your Mind” those drums are very well done by Jon Levine. I just looked at that session and it is about 36 stereo tracks of drums and percussion. The goal during mixing of these kinds of productions are to maintain all of the work that the producer has put it; we might not be touching much in the drums at all in this case; a bit of low rolloff here, a bit of high here, small level and balance adjustments. We might be doing a bit of panning changes to spread the drums and percussion, adding or tweaking some reverb sends.</p><p>The bulk of the drums mixing in this case would be polishing the work already done, fixing any problems, and mixing the rest of the song and the vocals so that all of that work and detail is not lost.</p><p>Mostly nothing special as far as plugins; I’m setting up and working like I used to on a console. <strong>There is an EQ, Gate, Compressor, Limiter, on each track.</strong> I’ll start with using those tools; if anything needs more specific effect or sound, I’ll start digging through plugins.</p><p><strong>Vox</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>• Nothing I can think of the is specifically done for male vocals. It is the same tools; Compression, EQ, De-Esser. I always try to mix vocals for intelligibility and artistic presentation.</p><p>I think it would be hard for me to mix my own vocals (if I was a singer). Does anyone like the way their own voice sounds on a recording?</p><p>Again, no special specific treatments on Bruno's vocals. Great vocalist, great recording engineer (if you don't know, Charles Moniz not only records all of Bruno in studio, but also does his Front of House in concert), great production, and great direction and collaboration with Bruno in the mixing process.</p><p>• I’ll have to tread lightly and generally here.</p><p>There isn’t a secret or a special plugin to achieve the “Serban Vocal Sound” It is all about his experience, taste, and skills.</p><p>Remember we are getting vocals from 100* (I didn’t count, I’m sure it is more) different producers, recorded by 100 different engineers, in 100 different studios, on 100 different microphones, 100 different mic-pres.</p><p>There is no way to plug any standard anything into that and get a specific sound.</p><p><strong>Don’t really do much parallel track mixing; again we’re “Old School” operatives.</strong></p><p><strong>General effects sends are pretty standard. A bit of chorus, a bit of delay, a choice of reverb(s).</strong></p><p>If a producer has sent us some specific effects, we’ll use / modify / work with it. If they don’t we’ll create it. It is maybe a 50/50 split. Remember that some of these producers could and have mixed and released on their own (Max Martin, Greg Wells, etc.) They are coming to Serban to make that final 5% to 10% or so polish. We’re not going to toss out what they have crafted and sent to us, but we will mold it to fit a little better if necessary.</p><p>• Yes I always mix into the master chain with limiting from the beginning of the mix. If you try to put something on at the end of the process it will undo or change a bunch of the work that you already put in. Mix into the glue!</p><p>In this way, you can also control the amount of limiting going on as you work; mix getting too loud? Pull everything down a bit. You can do this during the mix because you'll be able to adjust for how it changes things as you mix. If you do it at the end of the mix, it can change sound of the mix.</p><p>Some individual tracks will get limiters as well as necessary, or the volume of parts within the tracks can be ridden down as a sort of manual limiting.</p><p>I would say overall there is a lot more compression and volume rides being done than just hitting louder parts with a limiter.</p><p>I think that when we were mixing on a console, back in the Teddy Riley days, it was different. We would do the mix and then put the Master Compressor on towards the end. But in those days mixes weren't so loud out of the console and we printed back to 1/2" tape so we needed to get things under control for that.</p><p>• Answered in more detail elsewhere. We don't tend to do parallel processing unless it comes that way from the producer.</p><p>• I'll usually start with the whole song playing, listening down and making bigger volume moves as I learn the song. When I've got a pretty good feel, I'll turn everything off and start unmuting in the order from top to bottom of how I arrange the tracks. Drums, Percussion, FX, Bass, Guitars, Keys, etc. . . . BGV, Lead Vocals.</p><p>I'll generally do this adding each instrument as I go, i.e. not turning off drums when I start opening up percussion.</p><p>Of course I'll solo certain things to hear and work on specific issues.</p><p>When I've gone through everything like this and the whole song is open again, I'll then usually do my vocal editing; soloing vocals and cleaning them up.</p><p>Finally after that, I'll tend to leave everything on as I do the meat of the mixing; still solo'ing to nail down specific parts of course.</p><p>I think that this method lets me really learn the parts while spending the most time hearing drums and hearing where vocals relate to everything, which are often the key elements needing attention.</p><p>I guess I stick to this pretty regularly; but if something else catches my attention while I'm in the process, I'll go in and put that work in on that part as needed.</p><p>• If the song doesn't hit you right away, find something in it that you like. Maybe the percussion patterns are cool, maybe the bassline makes your head bounce. Find something and work out from there.</p><p>• I think you've analyzed this as well as I can. It is another thing that becomes habit and rote, but one thing that I think that we are definitely looking for is vocal clarity and overall clarity which has a lot to do with midrange, frequency masking, etc.</p><p>So all of the above.</p><p>• These are both mix and production decisions. I'll answer in reverse.</p><p>If it is not built into the production and we see something that can help this progression, we will make suggestions to the producer. Can I mute this in the first hook and bring it in for the second hook. Can the guitar part doubling the piano happen later in the song, etc.</p><p>Even producers at the top of the game are open to these kinds of suggestions if they have not thought of it themselves.</p><p>We are putting a good amount of time into consciously finding ways to give this energy build. I'll change drum EQ's, effects, use products to try to widen (Waves Center), open up effects returns so effects really kick in, even kick up the master fader volume 1dB in the hooks (so overall level doesn't really change, but more compression kicks in) Sometimes I'll also add effects to the master fader (global delay or verb) to really make the hook denser.</p><p>+1db chorus: why?</p><p>We're doing it that way because we want that extra bit of compression. It doesn't necessarily get louder, you're right, but it does get more density.  </p><p>I've found that if you make it actually louder, that mastering is going to undo that in most cases. Making it more dense with compression gives it the same treatment as mastering would do, but with more control in the mixer's hands.</p><div class="embedded-backlinks" style="display: none;"></div>
