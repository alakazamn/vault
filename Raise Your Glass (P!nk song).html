</table><p>Pink's latest hit, Raise your glass (&nbsp;<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="https://open.spotify.com/track/05qq6mwIbG1ZsQhlMKyDwN?si=0DXiVjYmQyy_Ht6wdlzdWg" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/05qq6mwIbG1ZsQhlMKyDwN?si=0DXiVjYmQyy_Ht6wdlzdWg" target="_blank">Spotify</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="https://music.apple.com/se/album/raise-your-glass/399792343?i=399792383" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://music.apple.com/se/album/raise-your-glass/399792343?i=399792383" target="_blank">Apple Music</a>&nbsp;), also started as a Johan Schuster demo.&nbsp;He had an idea for a house riff, fixed on guitar.&nbsp;Pink isn't too fond of synths, she wants it rockin'.</p><p>The intro's chopped G-D-C to C-Em-D is actually in the whole song, and with a melody that was a bit riff-like and followed the chords plus the four-on-the-floor kick, Johan and Martin prodded the song as finished as they could without having melody and lyrics completely finished.&nbsp;They took it to Los Angeles where Pink gave the thumbs up and they then completed the song in two days with Pink's lyrics and vocals including Max Martin's small but all-important twist in the melody over the E minor chord in the chorus</p><p>"Martin is absolutely fantastic at seeing what is needed in a song.&nbsp;He hears immediately where the error lies and usually has the tools to correct it."</p><p>Johan is also very impressed by Pink's vocal efforts.</p><p>“Pinks is fierce when it comes to record the vocal. When she sings a chorus it’s all in one take. And it’s spot on. When we do ad-libs with other artist we usually have to sit down try to figure out what kind of ad-lib it should be, how many and so on. Pink just says “go” and the lays everything all in once. She is amazing”.</p><p>The bridge, or breakdown, was another thing that came about in Los Angeles.</p><ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="0"><div class="list-bullet"></div>In verse and chorus, we are very strict that they follow our basic idea.&nbsp;Those parts are always very carefully thought out.&nbsp;The surprise(note: might mean catch or break?) can then be made up in the moment</li>
</ul><p>In Raise your Glass, a bar has been added at the end so that the whole part is twelve plus a bar with a snare pickup in bar thirteen, and here Pink does what 99 out of 100 singers would do: she charges for the chorus with "So raise your…” in bar twelve before she realizes her mistake and says “Aww, fuck”.&nbsp;A mistake that the whole world has now become familiar with.</p><p><strong>The energy is built up step by step</strong><br>
There's nothing complicated about Raise your Glass, which also makes it absolutely perfect as a pop production, but that's not the same as lacking details worth pointing out.&nbsp;The chords are the same throughout the song, but you don't experience the E minor sound until the chorus, where the melody rises above the E minor and sticks.&nbsp;The melody is also built according to a condensing principle where the energy is built up step by step (see<a data-href="Energy Management" href="Energy Management.html" class="internal-link" rel="noopener">Energy Management</a>, <a data-href="Melodic Rhythm" href="Melodic Rhythm" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melodic Rhythm</a>).&nbsp;The verse is structured but at the same time a bit hip-hop trippy in places.&nbsp;The B part, or pre chorus, then consists of the same phrase repeated five times in a row before the chorus pickup.&nbsp;The chorus then turns another round with its double phrases "never be-never be" and "come on and-come on and" which are more or less whipped in.&nbsp;Johan says that you never touch Pink's own rhythms these days.</p><p>The building also has a very clear off-on structure.&nbsp;Partly the division into lean hip-hop verses and hard rock fat choruses, but also within the choruses there is the same <a data-href="arrangement" href="Arrangement.html" class="internal-link" rel="noopener">arrangement</a> with the counter part in the first bar, over GDC, which then settles into a side chain-pumping fade-out in the second half's Em-CD.</p><p>If you just hear the song and don't listen properly, Raise your Glass feels sparingly scarred, which it is in a way.&nbsp;The accompaniment during the vocals in the first verse is just guitar and bass drum, but that bass drum is combined by nine different kicks on each channel.&nbsp;Of course you get a completely unique bass drum sound - I can't even imagine the mathematical probability that someone else could come up with an identical combination - but you can ask yourself if anyone in the target audience would notice the difference of seven or nine, while one can only surrender to Johan and Martin's accuracy when it comes to the details.</p><p><a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="https://www.studio.se/uploads/monthly_2020_06/shellback_inlay.jpg.507d52e2794ed804bf93edbc39635127.jpg" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.studio.se/uploads/monthly_2020_06/shellback_inlay.jpg.507d52e2794ed804bf93edbc39635127.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="shellback_inlay.thumb.jpg.400362409cb01f2ba2db20cdd5a9a08c.jpg" src="https://www.studio.se/uploads/monthly_2020_06/shellback_inlay.thumb.jpg.400362409cb01f2ba2db20cdd5a9a08c.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a><br>
One of many guitars stored in Raise your glass.&nbsp;Fender Jaguar with "matching headstock".</p><p><strong>Collaborating on the mix</strong><br>
The mix was done by <a data-href="Serban Ghenea" href="Serban Ghenea.html" class="internal-link" rel="noopener">Serban Ghenea</a> in Los Angeles who also mixed Pink's last big hit <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="So What (P!nk song)" href="So What (P!nk song)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So What</a>.&nbsp;Neither Max Martin nor Johan Schuster were in the studio, but that didn't mean they had let go of the helm.</p><ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="0"><div class="list-bullet"></div>He mixes in Pro Tools and sends his master bus to an iTunes here with us, so we hear exactly what he's doing when he does it and can tell him to tune a guitar, for example, even though he's sitting on the other side of the world working.</li>
</ul><p>As the mix is done entirely in Pro Tools, Johan and Martin are sitting with an identical mirror of the Los Angeles studio.&nbsp;You don't have to wait for mixes to be sent back and forth, but everything can happen in real time.</p><p>The step between mix and release was almost as short.&nbsp;The master was finished on Monday, October 4.&nbsp;On Tuesday the 5th came the radio release.&nbsp;On Wednesday 6 October, Raise your glass was released as a download.</p><h2 data-heading="Tracklist^[https://www.studio.se/artikel/intervju/shellback-%E2%80%93-med-max-martin-som-mentor-toppade-han-med-pink-r304/]^[https://www.swedishsongs.de/smf/index.php?topic=1066.0]"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Tracklist<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-dc4782586b4d258c" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-dc4782586b4d258c"><a href="#fn-1-dc4782586b4d258c" class="footnote-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a></sup><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-dc4782586b4d258c" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-dc4782586b4d258c"><a href="#fn-2-dc4782586b4d258c" class="footnote-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a></sup></h2><p><strong>Track 1 Side chain kick</strong><br>
– Here is a kick on quarters that is only used for side chain.</p><p><strong>Tracks 2-4 Loud Live Kicks</strong><br>
– Three live kicks from some sound library.&nbsp;Dirty with real room on it.&nbsp;These are the most bass cut on.&nbsp;It's mostly the room you get.</p><p><strong>Tracks 5-8 Hip Hop Kicks</strong><br>
– Four steady kicks with bottom and punch that stands for the body.</p><p><strong>Tracks 9-10 Hip hop kicks with room</strong><br>
– Two kicks with a bit more length on them that are cut in the bass.&nbsp;All nine kicks are throughout the song.</p><p><strong>Track 11 Hard Hi-Hat</strong><br>
– This one enters the pre-chorus.&nbsp;There is no snare here, but we have a hard, dirty closed hi-hat on 2 and 4 instead.</p><p><strong>Tracks 12-15 Snare</strong><br>
– Sampled snare in the chorus.&nbsp;Comes like all other sounds from our sound library.&nbsp;Four tracks dubbing the same thing.</p><p><strong>Tracks 16-17 Clap</strong><br>
– One clap on 2 and 4. The other only on 4. Only in the choruses.</p><p><strong>Tracks 18-19 Tambourines</strong><br>
– Entering the pre.</p><p><strong>Track 20 Tambourine</strong><br>
– Tambourine on 2 and 4. In pre and choruses.</p><p><strong>Track 21 Shaker</strong><br>
– Off beat.&nbsp;Kind of like a house hi-hat.</p><p><strong>Tracks 22-25 Hihat</strong><br>
– Four channels open hihat on the quarters.&nbsp;808 and crappy(dirty?) live hihats to get the sizzle.&nbsp;Only in the choruses.</p><p><strong>Tracks 26-27 Tambourines</strong><br>
– Sixteenth tambourines that lie right-left.&nbsp;They are lightly sidechained so they don't feel so static.</p><p><strong>Track 28 Cymbal</strong><br>
– Cymbal flap (panting).&nbsp;Comes from a live recording - a completely different song - that we borrowed.&nbsp;Hard cut at the bottom.&nbsp;Only in the choruses.</p><p><strong>Tracks 29-31 Lasers</strong><br>
– Three laser sounds that are in the 1's of the chorus.&nbsp;Like house lasers.&nbsp;Quite weak, but it's still a nice, subtle sshhhh that leads into the chorus.&nbsp;Three different sounds but all playing in the same place.</p><p><strong>Tracks 32-33 Crashes</strong><br>
– 909 crashes.&nbsp;Static.&nbsp;Sounds euro.&nbsp;Plays ones every fourth bar.</p><p><strong>Track 34 Machine hi-hat</strong><br>
– Plays fourths in the beat to get some modern punch against the acoustic guitars.&nbsp;Moves to sixteenths in the final choruses.</p><p><strong>Track 35 Live Drums</strong><br>
– Sampled.&nbsp;Helps with the snare into the final chorus.&nbsp;All bass cut away.</p><p><strong>Tracks 36-38 Bass</strong><br>
– The first is a synth bass, Yamaha CS-01 which is cut all below 200 hertz to get the growl sound.&nbsp;Then there is a Studio Electronics SE01.&nbsp;Ilbert usually complains about it: "Use a real Moog instead".&nbsp;It sets the bar really low.&nbsp;From what I understand it is a legacy of Denniz Pop.&nbsp;He always used the SE01 as a base.&nbsp;Then there is a live bass, Rickenbacker 4001 through an AmpFarm.&nbsp;All bases double each other.</p><p><strong>Tracks 39-40 Guitar</strong><br>
– This is the riff that you hear most clearly in the intro.&nbsp;A low octave and a high octave.&nbsp;The guitar is a Fender Jaguar through&nbsp;<a aria-label-position="top" aria-label="https://waves.alzt.net/x0e55" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://waves.alzt.net/x0e55" target="_blank">Waves GTR 3</a>&nbsp;and it was the first time we tried anything other than AmpFarm but Martin fixed a nice sound while I played like crazy.</p><p><strong>Track 41 Organ</strong><br>
– This organ was in a studio in Los Angeles.&nbsp;I think we have that plug... it's called B3.&nbsp;Only lies on one note in the choruses and a little lower in the beat.</p><p><strong>Tracks 42-43 Guitar</strong><br>
– Two crunchy Telecasters who are also just playing open chords in the chorus.&nbsp;AmpFarm.&nbsp;A Tele that was in the studio in Los Angeles and was very good.</p><p><strong>Tracks 44-45 Guitar</strong><br>
– Gibson Les Paul playing the loop, counter part, in the chorus.&nbsp;Sidechained every second beat so that the last note in the loop hangs and pumps.&nbsp;Everything that is side chained is controlled by the kick.&nbsp;A low octave and a high one.&nbsp;AmpFarm.</p><p><strong>Tracks 46-47 Guitar</strong><br>
– Two rock guitars only playing fifth chords in the chorus.&nbsp;Les Paul/AmpFarm.&nbsp;Left-right.</p><p><strong>Tracks 48-49 Acoustic Guitar</strong><br>
– Two lovely Michael Ilbert guitars, right-left, acoustic, playing open singer-songwriter chords in the chorus.&nbsp;Shit tight.&nbsp;Recorded with AKG 451EB.</p><p><strong>Tracks 50-53 Acoustic guitar</strong><br>
– Acoustic guitar, bridge, left-right.&nbsp;These were recorded in Los Angeles because we didn't have the bridge in Stockholm.&nbsp;Plays on the lowest strings.&nbsp;When the drums come in, two more guitars join in, doubling the first two with full chords.</p><p><strong>Tracks 54-55 Solina</strong><br>
– The string machine.&nbsp;Located panned left-right in the chorus.&nbsp;Plays very straight.&nbsp;Gives a little atmosphere.&nbsp;In the choruses.</p><p><strong>Track 56 Punky punches</strong><br>
– These are sampled punches or beats in the chorus: doooonnnggg, with cymbals and everything, and then we've just pitched them to match the chords.&nbsp;Also sidechained every other beat.&nbsp;Gives a lovely rock band feeling.</p><p><strong>Track 57 Guitar</strong><br>
– Fender Thinline that also plays the loop in the chorus.&nbsp;Also sidechained every other beat.&nbsp;Has an octave pitch up on it that gives a scary frequency that cuts holes in the eardrum. &lt;-- why???</p><p><strong>Track 58 Synth</strong><br>
– The Yamaha CS-01 again doing a double on the loop in the chorus.&nbsp;Also sidechained every other beat.</p><p><strong>Track 59 Synth</strong><br>
– Sidechained (Roland) Juno 106. Comes in under the B hook in the chorus and sparkles.&nbsp;Very low in the mix.</p><p><strong>Tracks 60-61 Guitar</strong><br>
– Called “Crazy Guitar”.&nbsp;According to the principle, play as fast as you can on a string and a note and then it is pitched according to the chords.&nbsp;Sounds like you've put the plectrum on a fan almost.&nbsp;Has delay and reverb on it and enters the second pre and is a bit in the groove and in the final choruses.&nbsp;On the next channel, it's the same guitar fixed pitched to a different note.&nbsp;Enters the final chorus.&nbsp;Fender Jazzmaster.&nbsp;As indie as it can get.</p><p><strong>Track 62 Solina</strong><br>
– Another Solina.&nbsp;Dubs the melody in the B hook and the end choruses.&nbsp;Also sidechained every other bar.</p><p><strong>Track 63 Guitar</strong><br>
– Called "Sad guitar".&nbsp;Also Ilbert who has recorded.&nbsp;A Jazzmaster recorded with real spring reverb in an amp and after that we've bitcrushed it and sidechained it every other beat.&nbsp;In the B-hook and the final choruses.</p><p><strong>Tracks 64-66 Piano</strong><br>
– Two sampled pianos and a Nord Piano.&nbsp;Places a beat on the ones every fourth beat and <a class="internal-link" data-href="Hypermeter.md" href="Hypermeter.html" rel="noopener">marks the start of the period</a>.&nbsp;Heard very clearly.</p><p><strong>Track 67 Vocals</strong><br>
– Ad lib channel.&nbsp;Pink's song ad libs.&nbsp;From the second chorus.&nbsp;All vocals are recorded in Los Angeles and the <a data-href="Vocal Chain" href="Vocal Chain.html" class="internal-link" rel="noopener">Vocal Chain</a> is Telefunken ELA M 251 to a Neve 1073 DPA, Urei 1176 Black and Teletronix LA2A.</p><p><strong>Track 68 Vocals</strong><br>
– Lead in verse and pre.&nbsp;A little dusted with EchoFarm to make it a little tastier.</p><p><strong>Tracks 69-70 Vocals</strong>  </p><ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="0"><div class="list-bullet"></div>Two channels dubbing the final words of each A verse, "What's the deli-o", "Where's the rock 'n roll" and so on.&nbsp;Panned right-left.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Track 71 Vocals</strong><br>
– Dubs every other sentence in the pre.</p><p><strong>Track 72 Vocals</strong><br>
– Puts the part in second pre.</p><p><strong>Tracks 73-75 Vocals</strong><br>
– Lead in the chorus and dubs left-right on the lead.</p><p><strong>Tracks 76-78 Vocals</strong><br>
– Three channels of a high harmony voice in the chorus.&nbsp;Located in the middle, left and right.</p><p><strong>Track 79 Vocals</strong><br>
– Me, Martin, Pink and her boyfriend, Carey Hart, standing and singing "Raise your glass".&nbsp;Little hockey choir.</p><p><strong>Track 80 Vocals</strong><br>
– This one is called "Talking shit" and is all little comments in the song.</p><p><strong>Tracks 81-83 Vocals</strong><br>
– Three channels undertone (harmony) in the choruses.&nbsp;Center, right, left.</p><p><strong>Tracks 84-86 Vocals</strong><br>
– Three channels where she sings the counter part of the chorus, i.e. the loop, with lyrics.&nbsp;Only in the last chorus, last 16 bars.</p><p><strong>Track 87 Vocals</strong><br>
– High part in the bridge with flanger effect.&nbsp;Sounds like that Led Zeppelin song…</p><p><strong>The auxes are four:</strong>&nbsp;number one with a quarter delay, EchoFarm;&nbsp;number two with a different type of quarter delay;&nbsp;number three has a half note delay and the last is a reverb.</p>
